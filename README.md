# Real-Time Intrusion and Injury Detection in Wildlife Reserves using YOLOv8

# Project Overview

This project aims to **detect human intrusions** and **identify injured animals** in **real-time** within **wildlife reserves** using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It leverages computer vision and deep learning to aid forest officials and wildlife conservation teams in enhancing protection and rapid response in natural habitats.

âœ… The system helps in:
- Faster intervention in intrusion cases
- Early identification of injured animals
- Improved wildlife surveillance

# Model Used

- **YOLOv8n** (You Only Look Once - Ultralytics version 8, Nano model)
- Pretrained weights are used and can be **customized with additional training** on a custom dataset.
