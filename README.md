# Real-Time Intrusion and Injury Detection in Wildlife Reserves using YOLOv8

# Project Overview
This project aims to **detect human intrusions** and **identify injured animals** in **real-time** within **wildlife reserves** using the YOLOv8 object detection model. It leverages computer vision and deep learning
to aid forest officials and wildlife conservation teams in enhancing protection and rapid response in natural habitats. The system helps in **wildlife protection** by enabling fast response and better surveillance.

# Model Used

- *YOLOv8n* (You Only Look Once - Ultralytics version 8, Nano model)
- Pretrained weights are used and can be customized with additional training if needed.
